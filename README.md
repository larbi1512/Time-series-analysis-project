# **Analysing daily total female births in California in the year 1954** 

## Abstract 
This study explores daily variations in female births throughout California for the year 1959. The data set provides a unique opportunity to examine potential factors influencing birth patterns within a specific year. Analyzing these daily fluctuations can offer insights into seasonality, potential healthcare system influences, or even random chance. Understanding these birth patterns can be valuable for healthcare resource allocation, staffing decisions, and potentially uncovering underlying societal trends.

## Introduction: 
The data set at hand focuses on daily counts of female births in California during 1959.
The data is extracted from kaggle : [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dougcresswell/daily-total-female-births-in-california-1959/data ]

 Understanding daily birth patterns can offer valuable insights for healthcare systems and society as a whole. This study delves into daily variations in female births across California throughout 1959. Examining these fluctuations within a specific year presents a unique opportunity. We can potentially uncover factors influencing birth patterns beyond seasonal trends.

Traditionally, seasonal variations are a well-documented phenomenon in birth data. However, daily fluctuations might reveal additional influences. These could be related to healthcare delivery systems, such as scheduled inductions or staffing patterns.  Daily variations might also reflect societal trends or even random chance.

By analyzing these daily birth patterns, this study aims to:

* Identify potential factors influencing births beyond seasonality.
* Gain insights valuable for healthcare resource allocation and staffing decisions.
* Uncover underlying societal trends reflected in birth patterns.

This project can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of factors affecting daily birth variations. This knowledge can then be utilized to optimize healthcare resource allocation, staffing decisions, and potentially even identify emerging societal trends.
